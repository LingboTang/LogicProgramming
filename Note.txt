    *              For any person(x)
    *              Exist person(x)
    * function symbols S(0), S(S(0)), father(X)
    * terms
            (1) a const, a var in a term
            (2) if f is an n-arg function symbol, and t1,...,tn are terms, then f(t1,...,tn) is a term
            (3)...
                * atoms P(t1,...,tn) P is a pred symbol t1,...,tn are terms
                * connectives, and, or, not, get, For any, ther exist
                * plus(S(0),S(S(0)),X)
